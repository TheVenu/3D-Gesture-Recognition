# 3D-Gesture-Recognition
3D gesture recognition trained using multiclass SVM's.
The matlab/octave files are used for processing and labelling the Microsoft Kinect dataset. A label is generated by considering a frame by frame for every video of every gesture. 
The python file uses multiclass SVM's to recognise test data after training.
